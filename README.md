# extraordinary-divine-office
An aim to compile a PDF containing the 1960 divine office and the corresponding music. I will be using the Liber Antiphonarius for the gregorian chant. I will be using TeX because there is support for gregorio. In specific, I plan to use LuaLaTeX.
Although I do not anticipate this becoming agroup project, anyone is welcome to help out. 
Note from the owner: I am a college student, though so this project might take a while.
